;;; Commentary:

;; This contains some extra completion functions for hippie-expand.
;; Names are subject to change

;; - `try-expand-multiabbrevs' - Allows you to define multiple ways to expand one abbreviation.
;; - `try-expand-local-abbrevs'
;; - `try-expand-local-abbrevs2' - Allows expanding skeletons
;; - `try-expand-global-abbrevs'
;; - `try-expand-acronym' - "tea." -> "try-expand-acronym"
;; - `try-expand-acronym-all-buffers'
;; - `try-expand-flex-dabbrev' - "texpv" -> "try-expand-flex-dabbrev"
;; - `try-expand-flex-dabbrev-all-buffers'
;; - `try-expand-dabbrev2' - Tries to mimic dabbrev-expand more closely
;; - `try-minibuffer-expand-bookmark' - Expand bookmarks in find-file
;; - `try-minibuffer-expand-buffer' - Flex search recent buffers in switch-to-buffer
;; - `try-complete-project-file-name' - Makes it easier to complete relative filenames

;; There's a function that allows "flex" expansion.
;; For example, "rpty" -> "reproducibility"
;; The first and last letters must match, and all internal letters
;; must be in order.

;; There's a function that allows for acronym expansion.
;; For example, "hss." -> "he-search-string"
;; Note that it has to end with a period to signal an acronym.

;; A couple functions are modified versions of code from
;; hippie-exp.el, and the author for that is Anders Holst <aho@sans.kth.se>

;;; Code:
(require 'dash)
(require 'bookmark) ;; For `try-minibuffer-expand-bookmark'
